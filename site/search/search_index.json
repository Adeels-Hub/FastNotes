High Integration : It provides deep integration with AWS services (Lambda, Step Functions, API Gateway, etc.), making it easy to wire together different systems, but also making it a dependency for multiple services. Dynamic Routing & Transformation : While it simplifies event-driven architectures, it also centralizes event routing logic, making services dependent on it.

No, for Complex Routing : EventBridge is better when you need event filtering, dynamic event routing, and integration with third-party services without writing custom logic. Conclusion \u00b6 You're correct that AWS EventBridge is effectively acting as a modern ESB. The difference is that it's more serverless, scalable, and event-driven rather than a tightly coupled middleware like traditional ESBs.

Here's how the book uses the terms \"message\" and \"event\" and what can be inferred about their differences: Messages: The book often uses the term \"message\" in the context of communication between services , particularly in asynchronous communication. For example, it mentions that in asynchronous communication, a caller posts a \"message\" to the receiver [1]. Messages are often associated with commands or requests , where a service is telling another service to do something or is requesting data [2]. For instance, the book talks about \"command messages\" in the context of the event-based eventual consistency pattern [3]. Messages are frequently delivered through message queues or brokers , and they are a primary mechanism for asynchronous communication [1, 4]. The book describes message queues as a means for implementing asynchronous communication, where messages are stored until they can be processed by the receiving service [1]. Events: The book uses \"event\" to describe something that has occurred in the system. For example, a \"customer unsubscribed\" event is mentioned as something that other services would react to in the event-based eventual consistency pattern [3]. Events are used as a trigger for actions in other parts of the system using a publish-and-subscribe model [3, 5]. Services \"listen\" for specific events and respond accordingly. Events are associated with the event-based pattern for eventual consistency, where services react to these events asynchronously [2, 3]. Events are often considered part of sagas , where a sequence of local transactions are triggered by the publishing of an event [6]. Based on these usages, here are some key differences that can be inferred: Intent:Messages often convey a specific action or request from one service to another. Events typically indicate that a state change has occurred in the system. Direction:Messages often have a clear recipient and are directed at a specific service. Events are broadcast using a publish-and-subscribe pattern, and are intended to notify multiple services about a particular occurrence. Context:Messages are often part of a command-response cycle or workflow. Events are often used to maintain eventual consistency and to trigger reactions in distributed systems. Although the book does not define a clear and explicit difference, it implies a contextual distinction: messages are usually commands, and events are notifications of state changes.","title":"Message vs Event"},{"location":"AWS%20Services/When%20to%20Use%20EventBridge%20Over%20SQS/","text":"\u2705 Use EventBridge when: You need real-time event-driven processing (e.g., trigger an action immediately after an event occurs).

You want dynamic event routing (e.g., filter & send events to multiple services based on type). \u2705 Use SQS when: You need reliable, durable message storage (SQS stores messages for up to 14 days). Processing can be asynchronous or delayed (e.g., batch processing).

However, not all SOA implementations follow microservices principles. Many SOA systems use an ESB, centralized data, and monolithic services, which go against microservices principles. The transition from SOA to MSA usually requires breaking down large services, decentralizing data, and removing ESB dependency. When to Use SOA vs. MSA \u00b6 SOA is better suited for enterprise-wide integration where multiple large applications must interact (e.g., integrating ERP, CRM, and third-party services). MSA is better for building modern, cloud-native applications that require scalability, resilience, and independent deployments.
